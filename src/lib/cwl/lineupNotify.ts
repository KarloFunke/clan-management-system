/**
 * The DB/notify half of the planned-vs-actual lineup check — `lineup.ts` is the pure diff.
 *
 * Fires once per CWL round, at reveal: the war exists, the in-game roster is locked in, and battle
 * day has not started, which is the only window where a swap is still worth telling anyone about.
 * Called from live.ts immediately after a round's members are upserted, so it always reads the
 * lineup that poll just wrote.
 *
 * Gated three ways, all cheap and all necessary:
 *   - state must be 'preparation'  — a war already in battle or ended is news to nobody
 *   - lineup_notified_at must be null — sync runs on every dashboard load; without the stamp this
 *     would repost for the whole prep window
 *   - the stamp is written ONLY on a successful send, so a Discord outage retries next sync
 *
 * Best-effort throughout, matching the rest of the notification layer: every failure path is logged
 * and swallowed, because a notification must never be able to fail a roster sync.
