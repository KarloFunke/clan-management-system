/**
 * Why an account is not in a clan's fighting lineup — the PURE explainer behind the roster board's
 * callout. No DB, no React, unit-tested like allocation.ts / lineup.ts.
 *
 * The allocation engine already writes a reason onto every account it EXCLUDES (`cwl_allocations.
 * note`: no eligible clan, family full, active strike, marked not participating). That column was
 * never read by the UI, so the board showed a name sitting in the Unassigned pile with no way to
 * find out why short of re-reading the engine's source. Surfacing it is most of the work here.
 *
 * BENCH is the half the engine cannot annotate, because the reason depends on WHEN you ask:
 *
 *  - While the roster is being formed, bench is a pure consequence of ranking — the clan was filled
 *    strongest-first and this account fell past `warSize`. That is explainable from its position.
 *  - From sign-up onward `signupReconcile.ts` overwrites the bench flag from the in-game lineup, and
 *    the game owes us no explanation. An account benched there can be the clan's THIRD strongest,
 *    at which point "ranked below the war size" is simply false.
 *
 * So the position is compared against the war size rather than assumed to follow it, and a benched
 * account that is strong enough to play is reported as somebody's decision rather than the engine's
 * arithmetic. Getting this wrong would be worse than showing nothing: a confident, wrong reason on
 * the board is what a leader would then go and repeat to the player.
